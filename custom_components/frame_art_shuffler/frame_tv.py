"""Helper utilities for interacting with Samsung Frame TVs.

This module provides art-focused functions for Frame TV control:
- set_art_on_tv_deleteothers: Upload and display artwork, manage gallery
- set_tv_brightness: Adjust art mode brightness (1-10, or 50 for max)
- is_art_mode_enabled: Check if TV is in art mode (screen may be on/off)
- is_screen_on: Check if screen is actually displaying content
- tv_on/tv_off: Screen power control (stays in art mode)
- set_art_mode: Switch TV to art mode (from TV mode or other state)

Power commands use the same KEY_POWER hold behavior as the Samsung Smart TV
integration to turn the screen off while maintaining art mode.
