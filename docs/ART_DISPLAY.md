# Art Display and Tracking

## Overview

Each Frame TV now has an on-demand "Auto-Shuffle Now" button *and* an optional auto-shuffle scheduler. Both paths use the same guarded upload pipeline so a TV never receives overlapping transfers, and both honor the TV's tag filtering preferences.

## How It Works

### Button Behavior

When you press the "Auto-Shuffle Now" button for a TV:

1. **Load images** from `metadata.json` in `/config/www/frame_art/`
2. **Filter by tags**:
   - Image must have at least one tag in the TV's `include_tags` (if any are set)
   - Image must NOT have any tag in the TV's `exclude_tags` (if any are set)
3. **Select randomly** from matching images, excluding the current image
4. **Upload** the selected image using `--delete-others` flag (removes all other images from TV)
5. **Update sensors** with the new image name and timestamp

Note: Manual button presses do not apply recency preference (see below). For recency-aware selection, use auto-shuffle.

### Auto Shuffle Scheduler

When the "Auto-Shuffle Enable" switch is turned on for a TV (or the option is enabled in the config flow), Home Assistant starts a dedicated timer for that TV:

1. **Frequency** comes from the `Shuffle Frequency` number entity (minutes). Changing the number immediately restarts the timer.
2. **Power-aware**: the scheduler relies on the existing `tv_status_cache`. If the screen is off *or* the power state is unknown, the shuffle is skipped, logged, and the next run is scheduled without waking the panel.
3. **Guarded uploads**: every scheduled shuffle calls `async_shuffle_tv(..., skip_if_screen_off=True)` so it reuses the same per-TV upload lock as the manual button and the `send_image` service.
4. **Health checks**: timers should always stay in the future. If the next scheduled time ever drifts into the past, the integration logs an `auto_shuffle_error`, records it in Recent Activity, and immediately reschedules.
5. **Next run + persistence**: the `auto_shuffle_next` sensor (see below) exposes the upcoming timestamp, and the same value is persisted in the config entry so it survives Home Assistant restarts. On startup the timer restarts from the saved timestamp instead of starting over.

When auto-shuffle is enabled, the manual button also routes through the scheduler. Pressing it immediately runs `async_run_auto_shuffle`, logs the outcome, and then restarts the timer so the next run remains frequency minutes in the future.

### Recency Preference (Auto-Shuffle Only)

Auto-shuffle applies a **recency preference** to avoid showing images that were recently displayed on the same TV. This creates a more varied viewing experience without requiring strict rotation.

**How it works:**

1. When auto-shuffle runs, the integration queries the display log using **dual time windows**:
   - **Same-TV: 120 hours (5 days) default** — images shown on this TV via auto-shuffle
   - **Cross-TV: 72 hours (3 days) default** — images shown on any TV via auto-shuffle
2. The union of these sets becomes the "recent" images to avoid
3. If fresh images are available, one is selected randomly from the fresh pool
4. If all eligible images are recent (small pool or high shuffle frequency), the algorithm falls back to the full candidate pool

**Key design decisions:**

- **Dual time windows**: Different concerns need different horizons:
  - Same-TV: "I don't want to see the same image on this TV for almost a week"
  - Cross-TV: "I don't want to walk between rooms and see the same image for days"
- **Configurable windows**: Windows can be adjusted from 6 to 168 hours (7 days) via service call or the Frame Art Manager UI
- **Auto-shuffle only**: Manual displays (via button or service call) don't affect recency tracking. Only auto-scheduled shuffles are tracked and filtered
- **Soft preference**: Recency is preferred, not required. The algorithm never fails to select an image due to recency

### Configuring Recency Windows

Use the `frame_art_shuffler.set_recency_windows` service to adjust the time windows:

```yaml
service: frame_art_shuffler.set_recency_windows
data:
  same_tv_hours: 120   # 6-168 hours (default: 120)
  cross_tv_hours: 72   # 6-168 hours (default: 72)
```

The Frame Art Manager dashboard provides a visual interface with sliders and live preview of how window changes affect pool availability.

**Activity log messages reflect recency:**

```
Shuffled to sunset.jpg (from 12 fresh of 25 eligible)
Shuffled to sunset.jpg (all 8 eligible were recent, picked randomly)
Shuffled to sunset.jpg (tag: Nature, from 5 fresh of 12 in tag)
Shuffled to sunset.jpg (tag: Nature, all 3 in tag were recent)
```

**Edge cases:**

- **Cold start / empty log**: All images are considered "fresh"
- **Logging disabled**: Recency preference is skipped, all images equally likely
- **Small image pools**: Will naturally fall back to full pool more often
- **Tagset overrides**: Recency is disabled entirely during an active tagset override. The user deliberately chose a different tagset, so the pool shouldn't be constrained by images from the previous tagset's recency window.
- **Tagset changes (permanent)**: Only images in the new tagset that were previously shown are filtered

### Logging

The button logs detailed information:

```
INFO: sunset.jpg selected for TV Living Room from possible set of images {beach.jpg, forest.jpg, sunset.jpg, mountains.jpg}
INFO: Uploading sunset.jpg to Living Room...
INFO: Successfully uploaded sunset.jpg to Living Room
```

### Edge Cases

#### No matching images
```
WARNING: No images matching tag criteria for Living Room (include: ['nature', 'warm'], exclude: ['people'])
```
Button does nothing.

#### Only one matching image (already displayed)
```
INFO: Only one image (current.jpg) matches criteria for Living Room and it's already displayed. No shuffle performed.
```
Button does nothing to avoid re-uploading the same image.

#### Multiple images but all except one are current
After filtering, if the only candidate is already displayed, the button will select another until finding one that isn't current. If impossible (only one image total), it logs and does nothing.

## Sensors

Each TV gets these sensors automatically created:

### `sensor.<tv_name>_artwork_info`

The primary source of truth for what is currently displayed on the TV.

- **State**: Samsung `content_id` of the currently displayed artwork (e.g. `MY_F0010`), or `None` if unknown
- **Attributes**: Flat dict of artwork metadata — schema varies by source:

| Source | Typical Attributes |
|---|---|
| Local shuffle | `source_type: "local"`, `filename`, `tags`, plus any fields from `metadata.json` |
| Web source (add-on) | `source_type: "web_source"`, fields from the user-configured attribute mapping (title, artist, etc.) |
| External change | `source_type: "external"` only (no metadata available) |

**How it gets updated:**

- **Integration-set art**: Updated immediately after every shuffle or `send_image` service call, with full metadata.
- **Web sources**: The Frame Art Manager add-on passes `artwork_metadata` (the `attributeSnapshot` from the user's field mapping) through the `send_image` service call; the sensor stores it directly.
- **External changes** (Samsung app, Art Store): Detected two ways — WebSocket `art_mode_changed`/`wakeup` events trigger an immediate `get_current_artwork` query; a 2-minute periodic poll catches mid-session changes. When an external change is detected, only `content_id` is known, so the sensor records `source_type: "external"` with no other metadata.

The sensor uses `RestoreEntity` to survive HA restarts, preserving the last known `content_id` and attributes.

**Example automation** (push artwork info to an eink display):

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.frame_tv_artwork_info
action:
  - variables:
      title: "{{ state_attr('sensor.frame_tv_artwork_info', 'title') }}"
      artist: "{{ state_attr('sensor.frame_tv_artwork_info', 'artist') }}"
```

Attribute names depend on the user's attribute mapping configuration in the web sources settings.

### `sensor.<tv_name>_last_shuffle_image`
- Shows the filename of the last shuffled image
- Example: `sunset_a3f2b1.jpg`
- Updates immediately when shuffle button is pressed

### `sensor.<tv_name>_last_shuffle_timestamp`
- Shows when the last shuffle occurred
- Device class: `timestamp` (displays as relative time in HA)
- Example: `2025-11-02T14:32:15.123456`
- Updates immediately when shuffle button is pressed

### `sensor.<tv_name>_auto_shuffle_next`
- Device class: `timestamp`
- Shows the exact UTC time the scheduler will attempt the next shuffle
- Returns `unknown` whenever auto-shuffle is disabled for that TV

## State Storage

The integration tracks four pieces of state per TV in the config entry:

- `current_image`: Filename currently displayed (used to avoid re-selection)
- `last_shuffle_image`: Filename of last shuffle (for sensor)
- `last_shuffle_timestamp`: ISO timestamp of last shuffle (for sensor)
- `next_shuffle_time`: ISO timestamp for the next scheduled auto shuffle (used to restore timers on restart)

These are persisted across HA restarts.

## Prerequisites

### Required Structure

```
/config/www/frame_art/
├── metadata.json          # Contains image metadata
├── image1.jpg
├── image2.jpg
└── ...
```

### metadata.json Format

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "images": {
    "sunset_a3f2b1.jpg": {
      "tags": ["nature", "warm", "landscape"],
      "matte": "none",
      "filter": "none"
    },
    "beach_x7y9z3.jpg": {
      "tags": ["nature", "water", "blue"],
      "matte": "none",
      "filter": "none"
    }
  },
  "tvs": [],
  "tags": ["nature", "warm", "landscape", "water", "blue"]
}
```

## Tag Filtering Logic

### Include Tags (OR logic)
If TV has `include_tags: ["nature", "warm"]`:
- Image with `tags: ["nature", "landscape"]` ✅ Matches (has "nature")
- Image with `tags: ["warm", "sunset"]` ✅ Matches (has "warm")
- Image with `tags: ["people", "portrait"]` ❌ No match (has neither)

### Exclude Tags (AND NOT logic)
If TV has `exclude_tags: ["people", "bw"]`:
- Image with `tags: ["nature", "landscape"]` ✅ Matches (has neither exclude tag)
- Image with `tags: ["nature", "people"]` ❌ No match (has "people")
- Image with `tags: ["landscape", "bw"]` ❌ No match (has "bw")

### Combined Example
TV config:
```yaml
include_tags: ["nature", "art"]
exclude_tags: ["people"]
```

Image evaluation:
- `tags: ["nature", "landscape"]` ✅ Has "nature", no "people"
- `tags: ["art", "abstract"]` ✅ Has "art", no "people"
- `tags: ["nature", "people", "landscape"]` ❌ Has "people" (excluded)
- `tags: ["city", "urban"]` ❌ Missing both "nature" and "art"

## Upload Guard & Power Awareness

- Manual button presses and the `send_image` service both route through `async_guarded_upload`, guaranteeing only one upload per TV at a time.
- Auto shuffle uses the same helper *and* performs a cached power-state check. If the cached state is off/unknown, the scheduler logs a skip and never attempts to wake the panel.
- Because we rely on cached state instead of fresh REST polls, the TVs never receive extra wake pings just to see if a shuffle is needed.

## Error Handling

The button handles errors gracefully and logs them:

### Missing metadata.json
```
ERROR: Cannot shuffle Living Room: metadata file not found at /config/www/frame_art/metadata.json
```

### Image file not found
```
ERROR: Cannot shuffle Living Room: image file not found at /config/www/frame_art/sunset.jpg
```

### Upload failure
```
ERROR: Failed to upload sunset.jpg to Living Room: Unable to connect to TV 192.168.1.100
```

All errors are logged but do not crash the integration. The sensors remain at their previous values.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Shuffle
1. Add images to `/config/www/frame_art/`
2. Update `metadata.json` with image tags
3. Configure TV with include/exclude tags in HA
4. Press "Auto-Shuffle Now" button in HA UI

### Dashboard Card
```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: button.living_room_shuffle_image
  - entity: sensor.living_room_last_shuffle_image
  - entity: sensor.living_room_last_shuffle_timestamp
```

### Automation
You can still automate manual shuffles (e.g., specific tags at certain times) by calling the button, but most users will prefer enabling the built-in auto-shuffle switch so the integration tracks the schedule, skips when the TV is off, and exposes status sensors.

## Technical Details

### Execution Flow

1. **Button press** (async, HA event loop)
2. **Load TV config** (sync, from config entry)
3. **Select image** (sync, in executor thread)
   - Load `metadata.json`
   - Filter by tags
   - Random selection excluding current
4. **Upload and display** (async, on event loop via `set_art_on_tv_deleteothers()`)
   - Uses vendored `samsungtvws` async art WebSocket client
   - All TV operations (upload, select, delete, get_current, available, etc.) are request/response — the library awaits a WebSocket confirmation from the TV before returning
   - Upload retries internally (up to 3 attempts)
   - After upload: `select_image(show=True)` to display, then poll-based verification
   - Old images deleted via `delete_list()`
5. **Update config** (async, HA event loop)
6. **Refresh coordinator** (async, triggers sensor updates)

### Concurrency

- Image selection runs in executor (blocking file I/O for `metadata.json`)
- TV WebSocket operations are fully async (no executor needed)
- Config updates run on event loop (atomic)
- Coordinator refresh is async-safe
- Per-TV upload lock (`async_guarded_upload`) prevents overlapping operations

### Performance

- Image selection: O(n) where n = total images
- Random selection: O(1) after filtering
- `set_art_on_tv_deleteothers` typical wall-clock time: ~12s (dominated by network upload)
- Post-operation verification uses poll-based checking (`_poll_until`) instead of fixed delays — checks succeed on first attempt in <1s when the TV responds promptly, with configurable ceilings matching historical worst-case timings

### Legacy Sync-Era Delays (Historical Note)

The original codebase used synchronous `samsungtvws` operations that were fire-and-forget at the WebSocket level — the library sent a command but did not await a TV response. To compensate, the code added fixed `asyncio.sleep()` / `time.sleep()` delays after each operation:

- 6s after upload (wait for image to appear in gallery)
- 8s after `select_image` (wait for display to update)
- 4s after `delete_list` (wait for deletions to propagate)
- 3–6s after `set_artmode` (wait for mode switch)
- 10–15s between display retry attempts

The async `samsungtvws` library (vendored v3.0.3+) changed all art operations to request/response — `_send_art_request()` creates a Future, sends the WebSocket message, and `wait_for_response()` blocks until the TV confirms. This made most post-operation delays unnecessary.

The current code retains poll-based verification only where confirmation adds genuine value (verifying `get_current` matches after `select_image`). Operations with reliable WebSocket ACKs (upload `image_added`, `delete_list` confirmation) trust the library's built-in confirmation and proceed immediately.

## Pool Health API

The integration exposes a REST API endpoint to monitor pool health — how many images are "fresh" vs. recently shown for each TV.

### Endpoint

```
GET /api/frame_art_shuffler/pool_health
```

Requires authentication (same as other HA APIs).

### Query Parameters (Optional)

Pass `same_tv_hours` and/or `cross_tv_hours` as query parameters to preview what pool health would look like with different window settings:

```
GET /api/frame_art_shuffler/pool_health?same_tv_hours=96&cross_tv_hours=48
```

### Response

```json
{
  "tvs": {
    "abc123...": {
      "name": "Fireplace",
      "pool_size": 500,
      "same_tv_recent": 300,
      "cross_tv_recent": 50,
      "total_recent": 350,
      "available": 150,
      "shuffle_frequency_minutes": 15,
      "same_tv_hours": 120,
      "cross_tv_hours": 72,
      "history": [
        {"timestamp": "2026-01-21T12:00:00Z", "pool_size": 500, "pool_available": 180},
        {"timestamp": "2026-01-21T12:15:00Z", "pool_size": 500, "pool_available": 179}
      ]
    }
  },
  "windows": {
    "same_tv_hours": 120,
    "cross_tv_hours": 72,
    "configured_same_tv_hours": 120,
    "configured_cross_tv_hours": 72
  }
}
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pool_size` | Total images in this TV's eligible pool (based on tagset) |
| `same_tv_recent` | Images shown on THIS TV within `same_tv_hours` |
| `cross_tv_recent` | Images shown on OTHER TVs within `cross_tv_hours` (excludes same-TV to avoid double-counting) |
| `total_recent` | Sum of `same_tv_recent` + `cross_tv_recent` |
| `available` | Images not recently shown, preferred for selection. `pool_size - total_recent` |
| `shuffle_frequency_minutes` | How often this TV shuffles (used to calculate variety hours) |
| `history` | Array of pool health snapshots over the last 7 days (recorded at each auto-shuffle) |

### History Field

The `history` array contains snapshots recorded each time auto-shuffle runs. Each entry has:
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp of the shuffle
- `pool_size`: Total eligible images at that time
- `pool_available`: Fresh (non-recent) images available at that time

This data powers the 7-day trend sparkline in the Frame Art Manager UI.

### Variety Metric

The Frame Art Manager UI displays a **Variety** column calculated as:

```
Variety (hours) = available × (shuffle_frequency_minutes / 60)
```

This represents how many hours of unique shuffles are possible before the fresh pool is exhausted and sequences may start repeating.

| Variety | Status | Meaning |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 10+ hours | 🟢 Healthy | Good variety, patterns unlikely |
| 5-10 hours | 🟡 Moderate | Some repetition possible over a full day |
| <5 hours | 🔴 Low | Sequences will repeat; consider adding images |

### Use Cases

- **Monitoring**: Check if pool sizes are adequate for your shuffle frequency
- **Tuning**: Decide whether to adjust recency windows or add more images
- **Debugging**: Understand why certain images keep appearing

### Frame Art Manager Integration

The Frame Art Manager dashboard includes a "Pool Health" table that calls this API and displays the results in a user-friendly format.

## Mood-Based Shuffle Composition

Active **moods** (driven by HA sensors or service-call overrides) can tilt the probability
distribution toward or away from specific image tags at shuffle time — without changing
the underlying tagset. See [MOODS_FEATURE.md](MOODS_FEATURE.md) for the full design.

In brief:
- Moods are defined in the Frame Art Manager add-on UI (Advanced → Moods)
- A TV is bound to a mood sensor via `set_mood_sensor` service; the sensor state is
  read as comma-separated mood IDs at each shuffle
- Active moods boost matching images, penalize or exclude suppressed images, and can
  inject search terms into web source queries
